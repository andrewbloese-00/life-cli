# LifeCLI
A CLI that interfaces with an SQLite database (local file or turso host) to track plans, habits, etc. Currently, an interface exists for Habits.

## Getting Started 
Check out the `.env.example.local` or `.env.example.turso` for a template of how to structure your `.env` file for your own use. 

There are two ways to store data: 
1. On a local sqlite db file. 
2. On a turso hosted sqlite database. 

## Running The App 
Currently the app is runnable by executing `app/index.js`, which is subject to change as the application reaches a more complete form (plan on creating a `bin/` in the near future)
